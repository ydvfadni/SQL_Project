# 🧠 The Analysis

### 1.Top Paying Remote Data Analyst Jobs
  To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst position by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlight the high paying opportunity in the field.
```sql
  SELECT
   job_id,
   job_title,
   job_location,
   job_schedule_type,
   salary_year_avg,
   job_posted_date,
   NAME AS Company_Name
   FROM
   job_postings_fact
   LEFT JOIN 
   company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
   WHERE
   job_title_short= 'Data Analyst' AND
   job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
   salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
 ORDER BY
 salary_year_avg DESC
 LIMIT 10 ;
 ```

### 2. Top Paying Job-Skills
  To understand what skills are required for top-paying jobs, I joined the job posting with the skills data, providing insights into what employer value for high-compensation roles.
```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
SELECT
   job_id,
   job_title,
   salary_year_avg,
   NAME AS Company_Name
   FROM
   job_postings_fact
   LEFT JOIN 
   company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
   WHERE
   job_title_short= 'Data Analyst' AND
   job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
   salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
 ORDER BY
 salary_year_avg DESC
 LIMIT 10 
)
SELECT 
top_paying_jobs.*,
skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
salary_year_avg DESC;
```

### 3. Top Demanded Skills
This query helped identify  the skills most frequently requested in data analyst roles. 
``` sql
 SELECT 
  skills,
  count(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
  FROM
  job_postings_fact
  INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
  INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
 WHERE
 job_title_short ='Data Analyst' 
 GROUP BY
 skills
 ORDER BY demand_count DESC
  LIMIT 5;
```

### 4. Top Paying Skills 
 Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying
```sql
 SELECT 
  skills,
  round(AVG(salary_year_avg),0) AS Avg_Salary
  FROM
  job_postings_fact
  INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
  INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
 WHERE
 job_title_short ='Data Analyst' AND
 salary_year_avg is NOT NULL
 GROUP BY
 skills
 ORDER BY 
 Avg_Salary DESC
  LIMIT 20;
```

### 5. Optimal Skills
Combine insights from demand and salary data, this query aimed to pinpoint skills that are both in high demand and high salaries offering a strategic focus for skill development.

``` sql
WITH skill_demand AS (
 SELECT 
 skills_dim.skill_id,
  skills_dim.skills,
  count(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
  FROM
  job_postings_fact
  INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
  INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
 WHERE
 job_title_short ='Data Analyst' AND
 salary_year_avg is NOT NULL
 GROUP BY
